# HashCalculator
hash calcuator application used on file or text data to calculate hash value, calculate the hash value of the file for various reasons include data integrity, security, and efficient
data storage.
data integrity: hash calculator  are used to ensure the integrity of data. By calculating the hash value of a file or string password. we can verify whether the file has been
                altered or corrupted. if the hash value of the file changes. it indicate that the has been compromised. this is commonly used in file transfer protocols to ensure that
                file are received or transmitted without any errors.

data security:  hash calculator are also used for security purpose , such as in password storage or digital signature.

 Algorithms:
            In hash calculator has used to various hash algoriths. using that algorithms calculate hash value.

            Hash Algorithm:
            1) MD5
            2) MD2
            3)SHA1
            4)SHA256
            5)SHA512
            6)SHA224
